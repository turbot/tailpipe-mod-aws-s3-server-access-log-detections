## Overview

Detect when an Amazon S3 object was accessed publicly, such as through anonymous or unauthenticated requests. Public access to S3 objects can lead to unintended exposure of sensitive data, increasing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized use. Monitoring these access events helps identify misconfigurations and enforce proper access controls.
