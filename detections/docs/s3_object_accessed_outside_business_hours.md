## Overview

Detect when an Amazon S3 object was accessed outside of typical business hours (e.g., 8 AM to 6 PM). Access patterns that occur late at night, early morning, or on weekends may indicate unauthorized activity, credential misuse, or automation operating without oversight.

Monitoring access timing helps organizations identify anomalies in user behavior, detect compromised accounts, and enforce time-based access controls.
